## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] A GitHub account
- [ ] Git installed on your local machine
- [ ] Basic knowledge of at least one programming language from our supported languages
- [ ] Understanding of data structures and algorithms (beginner level is fine!)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**

   - Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the repository page
   - This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

2. **Clone your fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Hacktoberfest-Beginners.git
   cd Hacktoberfest-Beginners
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/Hacktoberfest-Beginners.git
   ```

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### 1. Choose What to Work On

You can contribute in several ways:

- **Add new algorithm implementations** in any supported language
- **Improve existing code** with better solutions or optimizations
- **Add test cases** for existing implementations
- **Fix bugs** or improve code readability
- **Add documentation** or comments
- **Suggest new problems** via issues

### 2. Supported Languages

We accept contributions in the following languages:

- **Java** (`.java`)
- **Python** (`.py`)
- **JavaScript** (`.js`)
- **TypeScript** (`.ts`)
- **C++** (`.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cxx`)
- **C#** (`.cs`)
- **Go** (`.go`)
- **Rust** (`.rs`)

### 3. File Organization

```
Language_Folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProblemName.ext
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AnotherProblem.ext
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Naming Convention:**

- Use PascalCase for problem names: `TwoSum.java`, `BinarySearch.py`
- Use descriptive names: `LinkedListCycle.js`, `MergeTwoSortedLists.cpp`

## üìù Code Standards

### General Guidelines

1. **Write clean, readable code**
2. **Add meaningful comments** explaining your approach
3. **Include time and space complexity** in comments
4. **Use descriptive variable names**
5. **Follow language-specific conventions**

### Code Template

Here's a template for your solutions:

```python
# Problem: [Problem Name]
# Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
# Time Complexity: O(?)
# Space Complexity: O(?)

"""
Problem Description:
[Brief description of the problem]

Example:
Input: [example input]
Output: [example output]
"""

def solution_function():
    """
    Approach:
    [Brief explanation of your approach]
    """
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Add test cases here
    pass
```

### Language-Specific Guidelines

#### Java

- Use proper package structure
- Include Javadoc comments for methods
- Follow Java naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)

#### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for functions

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use modern ES6+ features
- Include JSDoc comments
- Use const/let instead of var

#### C++

- Use meaningful variable names
- Include necessary headers
- Add comments for complex logic

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Check existing implementations**

   - Make sure your solution doesn't already exist
   - If it exists, ensure your solution offers something new (better complexity, different approach)

2. **Test your code**

   - Include test cases
   - Verify your solution works correctly
   - Check edge cases

3. **Update documentation** (if applicable)
   - Update README.md if adding new problem categories
   - Add yourself to CONTRIBUTORS.md

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Commit your changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [Problem Name] solution in [Language]"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create the Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Submit the PR
