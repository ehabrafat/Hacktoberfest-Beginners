   - Example: `TwoSum.java`, `BinarySearch.py`, `LinkedList.js`

4. **Code Style Guidelines** ✨

   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add comments explaining your approach
   - Include time and space complexity in comments
   - Follow language-specific best practices
   - Use meaningful variable names

5. **Commit and Push** 📤

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [Problem Name] solution in [Language]"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** 🔄
